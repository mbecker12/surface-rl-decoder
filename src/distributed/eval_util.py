    Approximately calculate the optimal q value for a given state.
    The best possible q value should be
    when annihilating at least one syndrome
    with one action until no syndromes remain.
    Takes into account the annihilation of syndromes depthwise
    with one action.
    For simplicity, this has to disregard
    syndrome measurement errors which are
    present in the state.
    Also, this further approximates the real possible q value by
    only looking at average syndrome depth.

    Parameters
    ==========
    state: the syndrome stack for the manaully created qubit configuration
    gamma: gamma factor in reinforcement learning,
        to discount the effect of steps in the future
    discount_inter_reward: discount factor, to discount the depth of a syndrome,
        has the effect that, the closer to the top layer an annihiliation of syndromes
